# StroopEffectApp
In the Stroop task, people simply look at color words, such as the words "blue", "red", or "green". The interesting thing is that the task is to name the color of the ink the words are printed in, while fully ignoring the actual word meaning. It turns out that this is quite difficult, and you can find out exactly how difficult this is below.

It is very easy to name the color of the word "black" when it is printed in black (most text is written in black ink). It is also very easy to name the color of the word "red" printed in red ink color.

It is difficult, though, when the word and the ink color are different! This extent of this difficulty is what we call the Stroop effect.
